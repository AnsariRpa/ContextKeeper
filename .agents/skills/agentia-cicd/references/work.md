# CICD Work Reference

Use this reference for `agentia cicd work ...`, `agentia cicd cloud ...`, and matching MCP tools such as `agentia_work_get`, `agentia_cloud_commit`, `agentia_work_publish`, and `agentia_work_submit`.

## Current Story Context

Treat these as requests for the locally active Copado user story (from a prior `work set`), not a specific ID the user supplied:

- current story, current user story, active story, this story
- story context, work item context, what story am I on

**Resolve before continuing** (status updates, publish/submit, deployment steps, promotions tied to “this” story, and similar):

```sh
agentia cicd work get --json
```

Omit the positional story ID only; keep `--json` so agents parse the `result` object. With MCP, call `agentia_work_get` without an `id` when available.

**On success:** treat the JSON `result` user story as the story context for the rest of the task. Reuse any returned fields later commands or flags need (identifiers, names, status, acceptance criteria, functional or technical specs, pipeline or environment references, and similar)—not only `id` and `name`.

**On failure:** the CLI exits when no active work item is recorded (typical message: no active work item; suggestion to run `agentia cicd work set <id>`). Tell the user that no current story is set, include the sanitized error text, and stop. Do not invent an ID, run `work list` to pick one, or continue the original request until the user sets context or provides an explicit story ID.

## Choose One Workflow

Local and cloud work are separate delivery paths. Do not continue a cloud commit with local `work publish` or `work submit`: those commands inspect and push the local Git feature branch.

### Local Repository Flow

Use this path when the change exists in the local repository:

1. Discover and inspect: `agentia cicd work list --assigned-to-me --json`, then `agentia cicd work get <id-or-name> --json`.
2. Activate: `agentia cicd work set <id-or-name> --json`. This fetches the configured base branch, fetches the Story feature branch when it exists on origin, then checks out `feature/<story-name>` from that remote branch when present (otherwise from the base), and records the story, base branch, dev org branch, and pull-request context in `.agentia/config.user.json`. Use `--base-branch <branch>` only when intentionally overriding the Pipeline default. If the JSON result has `status: "warning"` (missing pipeline or credential), show that `message`, do not assume a feature branch was created, and note that branch keys (`lastBaseBranch`, `lastDevOrgBranch`, `lastPullRequestBaseUrl`) were cleared while `lastWorkItemId`/`lastWorkItem`/`lastWorkItemTitle` were recorded — stop until the Story setup is fixed; publish and submit will not work. If the Story source credential differs from the project default, work set warns with the current credential and environment and does not PATCH; use `agentia cicd work update <id> --source-credential <credential-id>` to change it.
3. Implement with Salesforce CLI, VS Code, or an IDE. Stage and commit with `git add` / `git commit`. Do not use `agentia cicd cloud commit` for local Git work.
4. Run project-owned gates: `agentia cicd work test --json`. This runs `.agentia_quality_gates.sh` or `.agentia_quality_gates.cmd` from the repository root when present. If those files are missing, it warns and runs `agentia cicd work test apex` via the stock sample from a temporary file. Local tests can be slow; pass `--apex-test-classes=MyTest,OtherTest` for faster, earlier Apex checks.
5. Register and synchronize: `agentia cicd work publish --json`. A plain `git push` does not register a Copado Commit or merge the feature branch into the recorded dev org branch. Pass `--permissions` and `--full-metadata` when nested detection is not enough.
6. Validate and open the merge-request flow: `agentia cicd work submit --json`. Submit runs the local gates unless `--skip-local-tests` is explicit, pushes ahead commits, waits if the last pending related job is a Commit template, and submits with validate-only behavior. `--skip-pull-request` skips opening the compare URL.
7. Only with explicit approval to promote and deploy, run `agentia cicd work submit --deploy --json` (or `--done`). `work done` is a compatibility alias.
8. Check asynchronous results with `agentia cicd work status [id-or-name] --json`.

`work set`, `work publish`, and `work submit` require a clean tracked working tree. `work publish` also requires the exact `feature/<story-name>` branch, recorded `lastBaseBranch` and `lastDevOrgBranch`, and at least one commit in `origin/<lastBaseBranch>..HEAD`. `work submit` fetches `origin/<lastBaseBranch>` and permits an empty commit range only for a Story with a Salesforce Data Set or Data Template deployment step.

### Copado Cloud Flow

Use this path when Copado should retrieve metadata from a configured source environment instead of using local Git changes:

1. Inspect the Story and pass its Salesforce ID explicitly when possible. An active Story from `work set` is optional, not a prerequisite for the cloud operation.
2. Start a cloud commit with `agentia cicd cloud commit <story-id> ... --json`. Use the simple metadata flags for one change, or `--file`/`--stdin` for a multi-change request. Always pass `--metadata-category` (use `SFDX` for Salesforce metadata). With `--file`/`--stdin`, each change requires `c` (or `category`).
3. Let the command wait for its Job Execution by default. After a timeout, use the returned execution ID with `agentia cicd job get` and `agentia cicd job log get`; do not immediately submit a duplicate commit.
4. When explicitly approved to promote an existing Promotion, use `agentia cicd cloud promote <story-id> --json`; add `--deploy` only for promote-and-deploy. This is independent of local `work submit`.

Cloud commit checks Story readiness and source credentials before submission. Avoid concurrent cloud commits to one Story. Treat `--recreate-feature-branch` as destructive because it can overwrite Story-branch work.

| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `work list`        | Find candidate stories                         | Use `--assigned-to-me`, `--status`, `--project-name`, `--name`, pagination flags.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `work get [ID]`    | Read story details                             | ID is optional after `work set`. Human output redacts OAuth signatures; JSON preserves structured fields. `--committed-metadata` also includes the Story committed metadata list as `committedMetadata` in the result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `work create`      | Create a story                                 | Use `--title`, project/team/assignee/theme fields, specs, and short acceptance criteria. `--source-credential` sends `sourceEnvironment` as null so Salesforce assigns the environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `work update [ID]` | Mutate story fields or status                  | ID is optional after `work set`. Acceptance criteria must be fewer than 255 chars. `--source-credential` sends `sourceEnvironment` as null.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `work set ID`      | Mark active and prepare branch                 | Fetches the base branch and, when present, the remote feature branch; creates/checks out `feature/<story-name>` from `origin/feature` when that ref exists, otherwise from the base; stores local context. A gateway warning prints the message, skips git, clears branch keys, and records work-item id/name/title. Warns without PATCHing when the Story credential differs from the project default; use `work update --source-credential` to change it. `--none` clears every `last*` key and checks out `lastBaseBranch`, else `main`, else `master`. |
| `cloud commit`     | Copado cloud metadata commit                   | Prefer `agentia cicd cloud commit`. Requires `--metadata-category` (or `c`/`category` per `--file` change); use `SFDX` for Salesforce metadata. For local Git work, use `git commit` then `work publish`. `cicd work commit` remains a hidden compatibility alias.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `work publish`     | Publish local commits and register with Copado | Requires active story context and clean tree. Accepts `--permissions` and `--full-metadata` when nested detection is not enough. `work push` is a compatibility alias.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `work test`        | Run local quality gate scripts                 | `--local` is default. Runs `.agentia_quality_gates.sh` or `.agentia_quality_gates.cmd` from repo root. If missing, warns and runs the stock setup sample from a temp file. `--cloud` is not implemented yet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `work test apex`   | Run named Apex test classes                    | Optional `--apex-test-classes`. Omit or pass empty to log a skip and exit 0 without calling Salesforce CLI. `--rerun-failed-apex-tests` reruns classes from `.agentia/apex.tests.<user-story>.json`. Optional `--wait` minutes (default 60). Usually invoked from `.agentia_quality_gates.*`. |
| `work submit`      | Submit for review/validation or promote        | Runs local gates unless `--skip-local-tests`; can push ahead commits. Waits up to 5 minutes when the last pending related job template contains `Commit`. `--skip-pull-request` skips opening the MR URL. `--done` and `--deploy` match Copado UI Submit when promoting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `work done`        | Compatibility alias                            | Prefer `work submit --done`; both promote and deploy rather than validate-only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `work promote`     | Experimental local promotion                   | Skips Quality Gates. Requires `enableLocalPromote: true` in `.agentia/config.json`. Merges `feature/<name>` into `promotion/<promotionName>`. Use `--backpromote --destination-branch` for back promotions; `--continue` after conflict resolution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `work environment-sync` | Sync next-env commits onto dest/dev       | Back-promotes every story behind the destination environment. Use `--destination-environment` or `--dev-org-branch`; `--continue --promotion` after pathspec conflicts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `cloud promote`    | Story-centric cloud promotion run              | Use `--deploy` for merge and deploy. Prefer this over local `work promote` unless you explicitly enabled local promote.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `work status [ID]` | Check story and related executions             | Useful after submit, promote, or commit jobs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Local Repository Details

Use Git for normal source changes:

```sh
git add -A
git commit -m "US-0001 add account service"
agentia cicd work test --json
agentia cicd work publish --permissions CustomField:Account.SLA__c,ApexClass:AccountService --json
agentia cicd work submit --json

`--permissions` on publish names metadata that Copado should treat as Retrieve Only. List the components whose access changed, not the permission set or profile files; naming those parent types is rejected. Use `--full-metadata` only for `Profile`, `PermissionSet`, `MutingPermissionSet`, `CustomObject`, or `CustomObjectTranslation` when that complete file should travel; other types are rejected. Both flags apply to that publish only.

`work test` and `work submit` take `--apex-test-classes` when you want the local gate script to receive them as `AGENTIA_APEX_TEST_CLASSES`. Sample quality-gate scripts pass that value to `work test apex`.

`work publish` detects nested metadata across the full branch diff from the merge base to `HEAD`, applies Copado environment-variable and YAML replacements, registers every commit in the range, and merges into the recorded dev org branch. Review unexpected Retrieve Only, Full Metadata, or nested-deletion output before continuing.

## Cloud Operation Details

Use cloud commits when Copado should retrieve metadata itself:

```sh
agentia cicd cloud commit <story-id> --message "Commit AccountService" --metadata-name AccountService --metadata-type ApexClass --metadata-category SFDX --json
agentia cicd cloud commit <story-id> --file commit-request.json --json
```

`--metadata-category` is required on simple flag input. Each `--file`/`--stdin` change requires `c` (or `category`). For Salesforce metadata, use `SFDX`. Without `c:SFDX`, Copado deploy logs can report "Salesforce changes not found."

For a cloud promotion, the Story must already belong to a Promotion:

```sh
agentia cicd cloud promote <story-id> --json
agentia cicd cloud promote <story-id> --deploy --json
```

Cloud commit and promotion wait for Job Executions by default and return nonzero on failed or timed-out jobs while preserving diagnostic IDs. If a Promotion reaches Merge Conflict, resolve it and resume the original execution; do not start a replacement run.

## Deployment Steps

Deployment steps are attached to a user story and run during promotion.

Prefer explicit flags for standard step types. Use `--config-json`, `--file`, or `--stdin` only when the step has expert configuration not covered by flags. Read `types` first when unsure.

## Gotchas

- `work test` is not CRT. For Robot Framework execution, use the `agentia-testing` skill.
- `work test apex` runs named Apex classes. Local quality gates (`.agentia_quality_gates.*`) usually call it with `-t "${AGENTIA_APEX_TEST_CLASSES}"` and `${AGENTIA_APEX_RERUN_FAILED}` (empty or `--rerun-failed-apex-tests`); an empty class list skips Apex without failing the script. `--rerun-failed-apex-tests` reruns classes saved in `.agentia/apex.tests.<user-story>.json` after a failure. Direct use is for a targeted rerun without the rest of the gates.
- Local Git work uses `git commit` then `work publish`. Cloud `cloud commit` is a separate path.
- `work submit` may push ahead commits, but the local flow still needs story and branch context from `work set`.
- `work submit --done` (or `--deploy`) promotes/deploys. Do not run it unless the user explicitly asked to promote or finish the story.
- `cloud promote` is not the next step after a local git commit; local delivery uses `work publish` and `work submit`.
- `work delete` is destructive; read the story and confirm intent first.
